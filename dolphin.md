### INSTALL DOLPHIN

Visit https://dolphin-emu.org/download/dev/23ed611077d65b43d9ef8f0971e9e5c57699fd91/?nocr=true and click the download Windows x64 button. This will download the .zip archive so that you can extract and run Dolphin. 

Go to your Downloads folder and right-click the newly installed file (dolphin-master-5.0-16666-x64). Click Extract All, and then in the new window, click Extract. 

Now you should have an unzipped folder called dolphin-master-5.0-16666-x64. Inside this folder should be a folder called Dolphin-x64. Open this and then run the Dolphin application.
